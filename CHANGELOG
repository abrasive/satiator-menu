# v61

## New features

- Support for CUE/BIN/WAV images, with many thanks to lifning for the patch!

# v60

## New features

- Reset to menu on A+B+C+Start. This requires an AR cart running patched firmware 3, and Satiator firmware version 154.

## Fixed

- Fixed AR Flash detection for AT29C010A Flash chips, which needed a delay
- When backing up an AR cart, length was calculated wrong, and only the first half backed up
- Revert to requesting a BIOS clock change on startup; this causes flicker, but is the easiest way to get everything neat and tidy on an A+B+C+Start reset

## Known issues

- The VDP menu workaround which fixes the Croc missing head bug (amongst others) will not work after an A+B+C+Start reset.

# v59

## Fixed

- The region free patch in v58 caused booting to fail on some consoles; this
    has been fixed. The issue was that a boot variable is in two different places
    depending on BIOS version. I had assumed the split was across v1.00/v1.01 in
    the original patch. This new version checks directly where the variable
    actually is, ignoring the version, so it should work on all systems.

# v58

## Fixed

- Corrected region free booting to work with BIOS 1.00. As region-free is now
    always enabled, the previous code would just hang after fading out and before
    the SEGA logo.

# v57

## Improved

- Support AR carts with an SST 29LE020 flash chip. Weirdly, this is a 3.3V
    chip, but still appears in some carts.

# v56

## Improved

- Support AR carts that have older SST Flash chips. These do not respond to the
    JEDEC standard flash ID read command, which led to them not being recognised.

# v55

## Improved

- Avoid changing clock on startup; avoids a TV resync
- Messageboxes are less ugly and wrap text

# v54 2020-10-20

## Fixed

- Fix hang if pressing C on the main menu.

## Improved

- Action Replay writing is faster when less has changed.
- Some AR Flash chips are faster too.
- Provide better error messages if Flash can't be initialised.

# v53 2020-10-19

## Fixed

- Problems on exFAT-formatted SD cards caused by a lack of parent directory
    information.  This included not auto-booting when entering a folder with a
    single image, and an inability to move up directories in the hierarchy.

# v52 2020-10-19

## Added

- Action Replay support. Backup, reflash, and erase AR cartridges.
    Erasing the cartridge allows you to use it as a RAM expansion.
    To do this with a stock AR cart, remove the AR and boot into the
    Satiator menu before inserting the AR.

# v51 2020-09-22

## Added

- Satiator RTC support. Files are now stamped on the SD card according to the Saturn's RTC.
