# v54 2020-10-20

## Fixed

- Fix hang if pressing C on the main menu.

## Improved

- Action Replay writing is faster when less has changed.
- Some AR Flash chips are faster too.
- Provide better error messages if Flash can't be initialised.

# v53 2020-10-19

## Fixed

- Problems on exFAT-formatted SD cards caused by a lack of parent directory
    information.  This included not auto-booting when entering a folder with a
    single image, and an inability to move up directories in the hierarchy.

# v52 2020-10-19

## Added

- Action Replay support. Backup, reflash, and erase AR cartridges.
    Erasing the cartridge allows you to use it as a RAM expansion.
    To do this with a stock AR cart, remove the AR and boot into the
    Satiator menu before inserting the AR.

# v51 2020-09-22

## Added

- Satiator RTC support. Files are now stamped on the SD card according to the Saturn's RTC.
